    // attribute tells that we can connect to the nameTextField property from Interface Bulder
    // weak -> indicates that the reference does not prevent the system from deallocating the referenced object
    // ! -> indicates that the type is an implicitly unwrapped optional, which is an optional type that will always have a value after it is first set. When you access an implicitly unwrapped optional, the system assumes it has a valid and automatically unwraps it for you. Note that this causes the app to terminate if the variable's value has not yet been set.

    // You only need an outlet to an interface object if you plan to either access a value from the interface object or modify the interface object in your code.
    
    // OUTLETS are used only for modifying
